## ✅ Email System Now Working with Real Service

The email notification system has been updated to use **Formspree** - a reliable email service that will actually send real emails.

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **Real Email Service**: Changed from demo mode to actual Formspree integration
2. **Spanish Messages**: All user-facing messages are now in Spanish
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Better feedback for users
4. **Real Email Delivery**: Emails are now sent to a real endpoint

### 📧 How to Test:

   - Hero section: "Unite a la Preventa" button
   - Email notification sections throughout the page
3. **Enter a real email address** (your own for testing)
4. **Click the submit button**
5. **Look for success message**: "¡Email registrado exitosamente!"

### 🔍 What Happens When You Submit:

1. **Form validation** checks email format
2. **Real email sent** via Formspree to: viazen.notifications@gmail.com
3. **Email saved locally** as backup in browser storage
4. **Success confirmation** shown to user
5. **Form resets** after 3 seconds

### 📨 Email Content Includes:

- User's email address
